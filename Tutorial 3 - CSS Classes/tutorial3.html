		<!-- Classes are used to have multiple "types" of a certain element. For example: -->

		<h2>Classes</h2>

		<p>This is a normal paragraph.</p>
		<p class="sans-serif">This is a paragraph with a class called "sans serif".</p>
		<p class="red">This is a paragraph with a class called "red".</p>
		<p class="large-spacing">This is a paragraph with a class called "large-spacing".</p>
		<p class="small-spacing">This is a paragraph with a class called "small-spacing".</p>

		<hr />

		<h2>Inheritance</h2>

		<p class="bottomstick">This is a div with id="box" and no class.</p>
		<div id="box"></div>

		<p class="bottomstick">This is a div with id="box" and class="red".</p>
		<div id="box" class="red"></div>
		<small>Due to <i>inheritance</i>, the box's width and height properties are carried
			over from its "red" class.</small>

		<p class="bottomstick">This is a div with id="box" and class="long".</p>
		<div id="box" class="long"></div>
		<small>Due to <i>inheritance</i>, the box's width and color properties are carried
			over from its "long" class.</small>

		<p class="bottomstick">This is a div with id="box" and class="tall".</p>
		<div id="box" class="tall"></div>
		<small>Due to <i>inheritance</i>, the box's color and height properties are carried
			over to its from its "tall" class.</small>

		<p>Its ok if you don't understand inheritance at this point, but its a useful thing
			to know about and you can always ask for help.</p>

		<hr />

		<p>Classes are defined in CSS. See "style.css" for more info on defining classes.</p>
