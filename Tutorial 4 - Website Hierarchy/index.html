<!-- For the sake of making it easy to learn, for the past 2 weeks I haven't properly
	formatted a HTML file, so I'm going to do it now. -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- This is a DOCTYPE. It tells the browser which version of HTML this was designed
	for. This is the DOCTYPE for HTML5. -->

<html> <!-- Shows the start of the HTML stuff. -->

	<head> <!-- You should NOT put visible stuff here, like text or a logo. -->

		<title>My Super-Awesome Website</title>
		<!-- This is often forgotten about. It is the text shown at the top of a browser.
		This is really important if you want your website to be identified by search engines like Google. -->

		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
		<!-- Links the HTML and the CSS. -->

	</head> <!-- End of the "head" section. -->
	<body>
		<!-- We don't need to specify the colour of the background of the whole page. Check the CSS for more Info. -->
