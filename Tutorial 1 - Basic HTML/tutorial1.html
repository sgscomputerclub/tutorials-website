		<!-- Welcome to Computer Club! To get the most out of this, you should have the HTML code (this) and the
			HTML file open in a web browser side-by-side. Feel free to edit anything below and change it to see how
			it affects the HTML page in the web browser and if you need any assistance, just ask! -->


		<!-- This is a comment. Anything after the <!-- tag is ignored. It can
			spread over
			multiple lines and will only end when you type: -->

		<!-- You are currently editing (or maybe you're looking at the source code) at an HTML file.
			You can see the source code of any website by pressing F12 in most browsers. -->

		<h1>This is a Header</h1>
		<!-- Tags are used to store content and define how it is shown. <tag> defines the beginning of a tag
			and </tag> defines the end of one. -->
		<p>'p' tags are used to define paragraphs. Any text in-between these tags will be displayed in
			a smaller size than the heading. To end this (really really short) paragraph, we must use
			another 'p' tag with a "/" before the p.</p>
		<!-- Making a new line in the HTML file doesn't actually make a new line in the HTML page. -->

		<!-- Using another <p> tag starts another paragraph. -->
		<p>This is another paragraph. If you want a line break, you can use the <br /> tag. Unlike other tags,
			we generally shorten the start tag and end tag into one tag.</p>

		<p>You can also format text. You can make text bold by using <strong>this tag</strong>.
			You can make text italicised by using <em>this tag</em>.
			You can also make <small>smaller text</small>, <sub>subscripted text</sub>,
			<sup>superscripted text</sup>, <del>crossed out text</del> and
			<mark>highlighted text</mark>.</p>
		<!-- Remember that creating a new line in the HTML code doesn't actually display a new line.h
			That's what the <br /> tags or <div> tags are for. (More on <div> tags in the next tutorial.) -->

		<p>On its own, the <span>'span' element</span> does nothing, however if we add attributes to it as
			such: <span style="background-color:red;">we can do awesome things!</span></p>

		<p>You can also do this with 'div' tags. The difference is 'span' works with horizontal spans of
			text, whereas 'div' creates an imaginary box around the content as such:</p>

		<div style="background-color:purple;
			color: white;
			font-family: 'Comic Sans';
			width: 300px;">
			Content can also go inside the 'div'. You can also have
			<span style="color: green; background-color: orange;">'span's within 'div's.</span>
		</div>

		<h2>Images</h2>
		<!-- This is another header, but h2 displays text smaller than h1. h1 defines the most important heading
			while h6 defines the least important heading. -->

		<p>Images can be displayed as such: </p>
		<img src="meme.png" />
		<p>You can add the width and height attribute to the following image like this:</p>
		<img src="meme.png" width="64" height="64" />
		<p>You can also change the "src" tag (src stands for source) to another website's image</p>
		<img src="https://github.com/fluidicon.png" width="144" height="144" />
		<p><small>Image taken from Github.com</small></p>


		<h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
		<p>Hyperlinks can be shown like this: </p>
		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a></p>
		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_(meme)">
			<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5f/Original_Doge_meme.jpg" width="125" height="93"/></a></p>

		<br />

		<p>That's it for this tutorial! In the next one we will be looking at CSS. This will allow you to create more
			beautiful web pages more easily. Hope you found this tutorial interesting!</p>
