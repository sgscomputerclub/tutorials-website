		<h2>A bit of a lecture about CSS</h2>

		<div style="max-width: 680px;">
			<p>HTML was never intended to contain tags for formatting a document.
				HTML was intended to define the content of a document, like:
				<h1>This is a heading</h1>
				<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
				When tags like "font", and "color" attributes were added to the HTML 3.2
				specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large
				web sites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page,
				became a long and expensive process. To solve this problem, the World Wide Web
				Consortium (W3C) created CSS. In HTML 4.0, all formatting could be removed from
				the HTML document, and stored in a separate CSS file. All browsers support CSS
				today.

		<hr /> <!-- BTW, this makes a horizontal line. -->


		<p>This text is not in any "div" tag.</p>
		<!-- It appears in a default font (Times New Roman) with no formatting. -->


		<!-- This is a "div" tag. It is used along with the CSS to layout a web page.-->
		<!-- The "id" attribute refers to the selector in the CSS. Look in
			"style.css" for more info on this "BlueContainer Tag" -->

		<div id="BlueContainer">
			<p>This text is in a "div" with the id, "BlueContainer".</p>
			<!-- You should always indent inner tags using TAB. It just makes everything
				look neater - the browser won't interperate it differently. -->
		</div>

		<p><strong>I recommend you take a look at "style.css" <em>now</em> and find out
			more about "BlueContainer".</strong></p>
		<!-- If you need any help, just ask! Tom and I are there to help! -->

		<hr />

		<p>Below are more examples of different CSS layouts.</p>

		<div id="layout1">
			<p>This "paragraph" (p) is in a "div" with the id, "layout1".
		</div>

		<div id="layout2">
			<h1>This heading (h1) is in a "div" with the id, "layout2".</h1>
			<p>This "paragraph" (p) is in a "div" with the id, "layout2". </p>
			<small>The point I'm trying to make is that you can assign different attributes
				to "children" of a div - ie setting certain attributes to the "h1" and "p" above.</small>
		</div>

		<div id="layout3">
			<p>This "paragraph" (p) is in a "div" with the id, "layout3".</p>
			<small>Hover your mouse over this.</small>
		</div>

		<div id="layout4">
			<p>This "paragraph" (p) is in a "div" with the id, "layout4".</p>
			<small>Put your cursor over this.</small>
		</div>

		<div id="layout5">
			<p>This "paragraph" (p) is in a "div" with the id, "layout5".</p>
			<small>This "div" has a large padding.</small>
		</div>

		<div id="layout6">
			<p>This "paragraph" (p) is in a "div" with the id, "layout6".</p>
			<small>This "div" has a large margin.</small>
		</div>


		<p>Now try adding/changing some of the CSS statements and see what happens! Have fun
			and be creative!</p>
