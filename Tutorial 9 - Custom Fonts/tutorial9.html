		<h1>Computer Club Tutorial 9</h1>
		<p>There are more fonts available than the ones installed on your computer right now. You can download more fonts from
			websites such as <a href="http://www.dafont.com/">dafont.com</a> and <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/">
			fontsquirrel.com</a>.</p>

		<h2>IN THE CSS, I HAVE MADE IT SO THAT "H2" TAGS DISPLAY IN A CUSTOM FONT THAT I CHOSE.</h2>

		<p>The convension is to use a woff file to display custom fonts on webpages. You can convert tff files to woff files
			<a href="http://everythingfonts.com/ttf-to-woff">here</a>.</p>

		<p>Most browsers will allow you to use a tff file (the most common format) to use as a custom font, but some browsers
			Internet Explorer won't allow this (only woff files). This is the main reason why many people  begun to hate
			Internet Explorer - in fact some old versions of Internet Explorer (below 7) don't even support custom fonts
			(font faces) at all!</p>

		<p class="CustomFontTff">THIS TEXT IS DISPLAYED USING THE "TFF" FONT FILE AS OPPOSED TO THE "WOFF" ONE. THIS
			TEXT MIGHT NOT SHOW UP IN MY CUSTOM FONT.</p>
