<h2>Computer Club Tutorial 6</h2>
			<p>I'm assuming you have your website now, or you're in the process of making it right now but 
				it's not online now - ie you type "yoursite.com" to access it yet, so let's do it now!</p>
			<h3>1- Register an account with a web hosting service.</h3>
			<p>For now, we're going to use <a href="000webhost.com">000webhost.com</a>, a site which will 
				let you host your website for free. I use it to host <a href="sgscclub.org">the Computer Club 
				website</a> and my own personal site, so go and 
				<a href="http://www.000webhost.com/order.php">create an account at 000webhost.com</a>. Make 
				sure to choose a free subdomain so you can host your site without paying for a domain, unless 
				you happen to own a domain already.</p>
			<small><a href="domain.html">What is a domain?</a></small>
			<br>
			<p>Afterwards, you'll need to confirm that you registered, by clicking on the link they email you.</p>

			<h3>2- Uploading via FTP</h3>
			<p>After your account has been confirmed, you will need to find your FTP details and put them into 
			Filezilla. See images below if you are stuck or ask for help.</p>

			<p>Then, you need to navigate to wherever your USB is in Filezilla on the left pane, and on the right 
				pane, you need to navigate into the "public_html" folder before you can upload all your files to 
				000webhost. (You can upload by right-clicking on a file in the left pane and clicking "upload".)</p>
			<h3>3- Alternate Uploading</h3>
			<p>For the first few days of hosting this site, FTP always failed to connect and I had to upload my 
				files another way.</p>
			<p>To start, navigate the root directory of your site (on your USB) and select all of the files and right 
				click and click "Send to ZIP".</p>
			<img src="http://www.sgscclub.org/tutorials/tutorial6/a1.png">
			<p>You then want to navigate to the File Manager, <b>navigate to the "public_html" folder</b>, click upload, 
				and select "Upload an Archive".</p>

			<p>Profit?</p>
			<br>
			<p>Note: If you are using a domain that you already own, you will need to point your domain name to 
			<a href="http://www.000webhost.com/faq.php?ID=41">000webhost's nameservers.</a> They have instruction on 
			how to do that <a href="http://www.000webhost.com/faq.php?ID=39">here</a>. <small>Keep in mind that you 
			don't have to go out of your way to buy a domain <em>just</em> for the sake of Computer Club, but if you 
			want to do so for your own use, a .com domain only costs about $15 - $20 per year.</small></p>
