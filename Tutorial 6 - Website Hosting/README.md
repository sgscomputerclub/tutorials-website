# Computer Club Tutorial 6
I'm assuming you have your website now, or you're in the process of making it right now but 
it's not online now - ie you type "yoursite.com" to access it yet, so let's do it now!
				
## 1- Register an account with a web hosting service.</h3>
For now, we're going to use <a href="000webhost.com">000webhost.com</a>, a site which will 
let you host your website for free. Go and <a href="http://www.000webhost.com/order.php">create an account at 000webhost.com</a>. Make sure to choose a free subdomain so you can host your site without paying for a domain, unless you happen to own a domain already.

Afterwards, you'll need to confirm that you registered, by clicking on the link they email you.

## 2- Uploading via FTP
After your account has been confirmed, you will need to find your FTP details and put them into 
Filezilla. See images below if you are stuck or ask for help.

Then, you need to navigate to wherever your USB is in Filezilla on the left pane, and on the right pane, you need to navigate into the "public_html" folder before you can upload all your files to 000webhost. (You can upload by right-clicking on a file in the left pane and clicking "upload".)</p>

## 3- Alternate Uploading
For the first few days of hosting this site, FTP always failed to connect and I had to upload my 
files another way.

To start, navigate the root directory of your site (on your USB) and select all of the files and right click and click "Send to ZIP".

You then want to navigate to the File Manager, <b>navigate to the "public_html" folder</b>, click upload, 
and select "Upload an Archive".

Profit?

Note: If you are using a domain that you already own, you will need to point your domain name to <a href="http://www.000webhost.com/faq.php?ID=41">000webhost's nameservers.</a> They have instruction on 
how to do that <a href="http://www.000webhost.com/faq.php?ID=39">here</a>.

Keep in mind that you don't have to go out of your way to buy a domain <em>just</em> for the sake of Computer Club, but if you want to do so for your own use, a .com domain only costs about $15 - $20 per year.
